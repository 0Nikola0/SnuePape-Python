# How it works
First the script scrapes the today's top page of the selected page.
Then after it has found the most upvoted page for the day, it opens it and gets the link where the image is hosted (so the original quality can be preserved)
After that it downloads the image in the wallpapers folder. And then finally sets the downloaded image as your wallpaper.
