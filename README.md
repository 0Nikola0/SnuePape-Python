# How it works
First the script sends a request to reddit to get the top posts for selected subreddit.
After it gets the response it parses it and extracts the neccessary data from it.
Next it downloads the image in it's original format and then finally sets it as your wallpaper

## How to run it
First you need to install the neccessary packages
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After you've installed them, just run the script like any other
```
python main.py
```
